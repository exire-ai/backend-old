# Exire Backend

Simple Express REST API for MongoDB Atlas with Stripe, APNs Notifications, and more.

## Running

All the keys have been disabled so, if you replace those, you can run:

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

## Disclaimer

This was our first experience with Express and contains a lot of repeated code and callback-hell anti-patterns.
